# Zorg
Simple flying game written in pure WebGL. The objective is to avoid colliding with the obstacles for as long as possible. Made for [CS460 @ UMB](https://cs460.org/) ([@bostongfx](https://github.com/bostongfx)).

## Controls

| key | function |
|:-:|:-:|
| arrows | plane movement |
| escape | pause |
| space | restart after losing |


### Speed

There are three speeds: slow, normal, and super.

Super speed may be activated by pressing the right arrow key once at normal speed or twice at slow speed; pressing the left arrow key will deactivate it.

While in super speed, the score increment doubles (from 50 to 100 points every 100 framesâ€”roughly 2 seconds). However, obstacles will accordingly move twice as fast.
